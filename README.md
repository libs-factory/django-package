# Django Package Template

A modern Django package template using Cookiecutter.

## Usage

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

```bash
pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"
```

Now run it against this repo:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/libs-factory/django-package
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django package will be created for you.

```bash
project_name [My Awesome Project]: Django Package Name
project_slug [reddit_clone]: django-package-name
app_slug [reddit_clone]: django_package_name
description [Behold My Awesome Project!]: A Django package for ...
author_name [Bin Nguyen]: Bin Nguyen
email [binnguyen@yourdomain.com]: pydanny@gmail.com
```
